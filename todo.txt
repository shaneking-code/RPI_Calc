From URLs

rpiapp/leagues/ -> view all leagues in db
rpiapp/leagues/league_id -> view specific league
rpiapp/leagues/league_id/seasons/season_id -> view specific season from a specific league

rpiapp/games/game_id -> view specific game
rpiapp/teams/team_id -> view specific team

# Should I have the urls be rpiapp/leagues/league_id/teams/team_id?
# Pros: Establishes clear hierarchy and shows relationships between each
# Cons: Long and laborious to handcode

In general:
    - Possibly flesh out db even more
    - Add another league/more leagues

Longterm:
    - Add users
    - Add ability to share between users
    - Add search ability for leagues, teams, games
